## Introduction

Modern payment solutions have evolved with the advent of UPI-based apps, making transactions seamless for users. However, understanding user sentiment and experience is crucial for continuous improvement. In this project, we analyze customer feedback and ratings to gain insights into user perceptions of Google UPI, Paytm, and PhonePay.

## Data Preprocessing

Before diving into analysis, we preprocess the data by identifying and handling outliers in numeric columns. This step ensures that our insights are based on a refined dataset.

## Exploratory Data Analysis

We conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) individually for each company to uncover distinct insights:

### Google UPI

- Management's responsive approach towards addressing low-scoring feedback.
- Correlation between negative ratings and high vote counts.

### Paytm

- Balanced management responses across various rating categories.
- Relationship between negative ratings and upvote counts.

### PhonePay

- Equilibrium in management responses for different rating categories.
- Lower negative and average ratings suggest smoother user experiences.
- Upvote concentration in Very Negative (0-1) and Average (2-3) ratings.

## Overall Review of All Three Companies

- **Paytm** shines with the highest ratings, signifying strong customer satisfaction.
- **PhonePay** closely follows, indicating competitive services.
- **Google** lags behind, necessitating improvements.

- Negative ratings predominantly target **Google**, signaling a need for service enhancement.
- **Paytm** records fewer negative reviews, indicating a positive trend.

- **Paytm** and **PhonePay** gather more feedback, but limited data requires cautious interpretation.
- November registers peak feedback for **PhonePay**, with data limitations for precise conclusions.

## Conclusion

Through our in-depth analysis, we offer actionable insights for these UPI payment giants. **Paytm** stands out as a leader, with **PhonePay** in close pursuit, and **Google** poised for improvements. Our analysis offers a snapshot of user perceptions, equipping these companies to fine-tune their services.
